    Attribute access:

    Model property values can be accessed as attributes with the same name.
    Because there are no restrictions in the Swagger spec on the names of
    model properties, there is no way to avoid conflicts between those and
    the names of attributes used in the Python implementation of the model
    (methods, etc.). The solution here is to have all non-property attributes
    making up the public API of this class prefixed by a single underscore
    (this is done with the :func:`collections.namedtuple` type factory, which
    also uses property values with arbitrary names). There may still be name
    conflicts but only if the property name also begins with an undersecore,
    which is uncommon. Truly private attributes are prefixed with double
    underscores in the source code (and thus by "_Model__" after
    `name-mangling`_).

    Attribute access has been modified somewhat from the Python default.
    Non-dynamic attributes like methods, etc. will always be returned over
    property values when there is a name conflict. To access a property
    explicitly use the ``model[prop_name]`` syntax as if it were a dictionary
    (setting and deleting properties also works).
