# TODO: avoids an issue with hanging forever in tests (CORESERV-12009).
# Inclusion of rfc3339-validator here is a workaround for an issue where
# pip is not installing this package (defined by `jsonschema[format-nongpl]`).
# This issue sounds similar to https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/3903, but
# that was fixed in pip 20.3 and we're still seeing this issue on 22.0.2.
